# Osmosis_Filtering_using_ADI_and_OS
This repository contains a Matlab implementation of the osmosis filtering for shadow removal and seamless cloning

## Introduction

The anisotropic osmosis filtering is a drift-diffusion partial differential equation written as:

</p>

where **d** is the vector drift field. For isotropic diffusion, **W** is set to an identity matrix. A detailed explanation of the model can be found in [[1]](#1) to [[4]](#4).

In this project, we implemented a solver for the osmosis model based on the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method and the Operator Splitting (OS) method. The applications include shadow removal and seamless cloning.
